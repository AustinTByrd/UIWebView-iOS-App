# UIWebView-iOS-App
My school had no easy way of clocking-in for their Worker Program without digging through emails for a link. I made this in an hour as a super simple, fun introduction into iOS development. A lot of improvements could be made, like an actual UI or a CSS file for the website. However, Lindenwood is switching to a different Human Resource software next semester, so those changes would be frivolous.
